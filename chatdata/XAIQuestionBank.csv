intent,question
performance,How accurate/precise/reliable are the predictions?
performance,How often does the system make mistakes?
performance,In what situations is the system likely to be correct/incorrect?
performance,What are the limitations of the system?
performance,What kind of mistakes is the system likely to make?
performance,Is the system's performance good enough for...
why,explain it to me
why,why?
why,how was this calculated?
why,Why/how is this instance given this prediction?
why,What feature(s) of this instance leads to the system's prediction? 
why,Why are instance A and B) given the same prediction?
what if,What would the system predict if this instance changes to...?
what if,What would the system predict if this feature of the instance changes to...?
what if,What would the system predict for a different instance)?
how to be that,How should this instance change to get a different prediction? 
how to be that,How should this feature change for this instance to get a different prediction?
how to be that,What kind of instance gets a different prediction?
feature importance,Which are the most important variable(s)?
feature importance,give me top feature importance
feature importance,Does this feature infuence on prediction?
exemplar,give me a exemplar
exemplar,what about instances similar to this instance
exemplar,show me an instance similar to this instance
counter exemplar,what about instances that is not similar to this instance
counter exemplar,what is the nearest neighbour that is not similar to this instance
counter exemplar,give me a counter exemplar
